      <h2>3D design</h2>
      <p>
        In this chapter i will only learn basic 3D design in unity, if you want
        to learn advanced 3D design press this
        <a href="https://unity.com/learn/professionals/course-catalog">link.</a>
      </p>

      <h3>Terrain</h3>
      <p>
        The first step into build a 3D open world is by creating the ground wich
        is done by the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Right click on the Hierarchy window</li>
        <li>go to 3D-object > Terrain</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In the inspector window you get a few option to use when styling your
        enviroment
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Create Neighbor Terrains, if you want a lage map you could just press
          an neighboring square and it will expand your map
        </li>
        <li>
          Paint Terrain, this tool is used to style terrain topology, material,
          texture
        </li>
        <li>
          Paint Trees, this tool is used to style and place down trees both
          individualy and mass placement
        </li>
        <li>
          Paint Details, this tool works just like Paont Trees and lets you
          place out singel or multiple objects
        </li>
        <li>
          Terrain Settings, here you could enable shadow, resolution, materials
          etc
        </li>
      </ol>
      <img
        src="/Pictures/Skarmbild(214).PNG"
        alt="picture of the terrain editor the 5 tools highlighted"
      >
      <h4>Paint Terrain - tool</h4>
      <p>
        Right beneth the paint Terrain button markt in red is a action bar where
        you could chose how you want to affect the terrain topology, if you want
        to higher or lower the ground or maby flaten in out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Underneth those option you has the paint tool that work in a similar way
        in all the other terrain styling tools, you get to set your brush
        stucture, brush size and opacity and then you drag it around the map and
        press/hold down every time you want to apply the effect
      </p>
      <img
        src="/Pictures/Skarmbild(200).PNG"
        alt="picture of the terrain editorand the tools highlighted"
      >

      <p>
        The "Paint Texture" is maby the one that stands out from the rest of the
        actions most. Additional to the brush you also have to make a terrain
        layer meaning that you need to add a texture for your brush. They way
        you are doing that is as following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Press the "Edit Terrain Layers" button</li>
        <li>
          Press "add layer" - now you should have gotten a popup window loking
          simmilar to that in the picture below
        </li>

        <li>
          if you alredy has textures you will se them her and can by
          dubbletaping one chose that texture
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note/tip/hint: If their not popping up any textures its most likely that
        you havent any textures downloded but dont wory, its easy to fix, just
        follow this <a href="https://polyhaven.com/textures">link</a> to find
        downloadaple textures and so much more
      </p>

      <h3>objects</h3>
      <p>
        If you want to build easy objects by yourself Unity has a few built in
        objects that you could acces through the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>right click on the hierarchy window</li>
        <li>navigate to "3D-object</li>
        <li>chose what kind of object you want</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        As with most of the objects in Unity you could also inport them from 3d
        partys to speed up the design phase
      </p>
      <p>
        But whatever you make the objects yourself or from a website you will be
        able to make plenty of modifications in the inspector window and here
        follow three of what i think is the most usefull ones:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Transform - here you could change the position, rotation and scale of
          your object
        </li>
        <li>
          Mesh Renderer - most of the settings here you could just leave but som
          intresting is the shadows and lightning
        </li>
        <li>
          Box Collider - uses to determine how two objects will react when they
          colide
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img
        src="/Pictures/Skarmbild(223).PNG"
        alt="Picture of how to create a qube"
      >

      <!-- Unity Editor is your workspace and its here you acully makes your prodjects-->
      <h3>texture</h3>
      <p>
        The object has still a boring color and but fixing it is as easy as to
        navigate to the materials in your project window and draging the
        material you want onto the object and it will be automaticly changed
      </p>
